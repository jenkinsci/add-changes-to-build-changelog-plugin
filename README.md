# Add Changes to Jenkins Changelog Plugin

## About

A plugin to add a custom changelog to a jenkins build via file or string.

## Target Audience

Stack Overflow had a lot of questions regarding adding custom changes to the Jenkins change log, but there was no easy way to do this.  Most relied on knowing the Jenkins internals and scripting.  Thus, this plugin was created to help.

For example, here are some of those questions:

[Jenkins - Updating build changelog during build step](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14047974)

[Is there a way to set/change the changeSet (changelog) content from pipeline script? Needed for preflight type of job](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60565782)

[Generating Custom GitSCM Changelog in Jenkins Pipeline](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42810248)

[insert custom changelog to Jenkins job](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44126901)

## Usage

-   Freestyle Jobs
-   Pipeline

## Pipeline Builds

> **Warning**
> The format of the changelog text you're inserting must match the jenkins git SCM type.  Internally anything you add to the build will be treated as a Git change.

Example pipeline script:
```
node {
    def text = """commit 364cd043160d870b655f66c5925b18b9e14961e1
author Jane Doe <jane@doe.com> 2023-02-03 07:30:05 +0000
committer Jane Doe <jane@doe.com> 2023-02-03 07:30:05 +0000

    My git change.

:100644 100644 8bdc86e3cf958f80a15e39dae910c28292bf3030 88944b4f9832a5ccd85d48a9ea4b824b0e7233fd M    hello.txt"""
    
    // Read in the changes via text
    addchangestobuildchangelog changelogText: text
    
    // Read in the changes via file path
    writeFile file: 'changelog.txt', text: text
    addchangestobuildchangelog changelogPath: 'changelog.txt'
}
```

## Freestyle Builds

> **Warning**
> The format of the changelog text you're inserting must match whatever SCM type you have defined in your job's configuration. For example, if you define SVN as your default checkout, then all custom changes must be in that same format.  SCM type of None are not supported and will throw an exception.

Example Subversion changelog text:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <log>
            <logentry revision="123456">
            <author>jdoe</author>
            <date>2023-01-19T04:45:33.384807Z</date>
            <paths>
                  <path action="M" localPath="home/hello.txt" kind="file">/home/hello.txt</path>
            </paths>
            <msg>My svn change.</msg>
      </logentry>
</log>
```

```
